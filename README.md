# Salary Prediction Project 📊💼

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting salaries using machine learning techniques applied to a dataset. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model building to predict salaries based on various independent variables.

## Dataset Information
📋 The dataset used for this project contains information related to salary prediction, including numeric and categorical variables.

### Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Data Types: The dataset includes both numeric and categorical data types.
- Missing Values: Missing values were handled appropriately using imputation methods.
- Numeric Variable Distributions: Analyzed using Q-Q plots to determine distribution types.

### Feature Selection
🔍 Identified the most relevant independent variables for predicting salary using multiple methods:
- Correlation analysis
- Random Forest feature importance
- Univariate feature selection (ANOVA F-value)

### Missing Data Analysis
- Checked for missing data in independent variables and applied imputation techniques.

### Data Consistency
- Ensured training and test datasets were consistent in terms of data distribution and characteristics.

### Model Interpretation
📈 Determined important predictor variables using Random Forest feature importance.
- Evaluated predictor variable ranges and distributions for consistency and relevance.

### Outliers and Imputation
- Removed outliers using z-score and evaluated their impact on model performance.
- Implemented random data removal and imputation to assess recovery of missing values.

### Categorical Data Analysis
- Calculated accuracy metrics and confusion matrices for categorical variables.

## Conclusion
🎯 This project successfully tackled the task of predicting salaries by leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. Through comprehensive data cleaning, rigorous exploration, and strategic feature selection, we identified key predictors influencing salary outcomes. The models built exhibited robust performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in handling both numeric and categorical data. Moving forward, continued refinement and exploration of alternative models could further enhance prediction accuracy and applicability in real-world scenarios.
